# 1 - Get value of number from input as string
# 2 - display one by one each character (number) in string
# 3 - check wich number is biggest and smallest number in string



# step1
# number = input()



# step2
# number = input()
# for i in range(len(number)):
#     print(number[i])



# step3
# number = input()
# big = "0"
# small = ""
# for i in range(len(number)):
#     if int(number[i]) > int(big):
#         big = str(number[i])
#     if int(number[i]) < int(number[0]):
#         small = str(number[i])
#     else:
#         small = str(number[0])
# print(big + " is big")
# print(small + " is small")
